# Project Name
Image Recommendation

## Project Overview
The Image Recommendation Project is designed to provide users with intelligent and personalized image suggestions based on the content of the images they upload. 
Leveraging the power of machine learning and cloud services, the project integrates Azure Custom Vision, Azure Storage, and MongoDB to deliver accurate predictions
and efficient storage.

## Services Used
### 1. Azure Custom Vision

Azure Custom Vision was used to train a custom vision model for predicting image tags based on specific categories.
Azure Custom Vision is employed for training a custom machine learning model specifically tailored for image classification 
based on predefined categories (tags).

**Training URL:** [Azure Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai)
- **Training Key:** Replace_with_your_training_key


How It Works:

The training dataset comprises images labeled with categories such as "men dress," "women footwear," etc.
The model is trained to recognize these categories, achieving a high level of accuracy through iterative training cycles.
Once trained, the model is deployed to the Azure Custom Vision service, ready to make predictions on new images.

### 2. Azure Storage

Azure Storage serves as the storage solution for managing and hosting images.
Azure Storage serves as the primary repository for storing and managing user-uploaded images.

How It Works:

When a user uploads an image, it is securely stored in Azure Blob Storage.
The storage architecture allows for efficient retrieval and delivery of images to the user interface.

- **Storage Account:** [Your Storage Account](https://portal.azure.com/)
- **Connection String:** Replace_with_your_connection_string
- **Container Name:** mystorage01
  

### 3. MongoDB

MongoDB is utilized for storing predictions and relevant information.
MongoDB is used as the backend database to store predictions generated by the Azure Custom Vision model.

How It Works:

After an image is uploaded, the predictions (tags and categories) made by the Custom Vision model are logged into the MongoDB database.
The schema includes fields such as imageUrl, predictedTags, and timestamp.
MongoDB enables seamless retrieval and analysis of prediction data, contributing to user profiling and adaptive recommendations.

- **Database Name:** mydb01
- **Collection Name:** your_collection_name
